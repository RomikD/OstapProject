            <h2 class="h4">Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>CustomerLab, Inc. ("CustomerLab") owns and operates a proprietary marketing technology platform. Using unique phone numbers with personalization components combined with database management, CustomerLab provides networks, advertisers, agencies, publishers (directly and indirectly "Clients"), and consumers with marketing automation services (the "Services"). Privacy is important to CustomerLab and any information that is collected or used is limited to what is necessary to create and maintain innovative and reliable Services without compromising the The use of information collected through CustomerLab Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged CustomerLab, Inc.</p>
            <p><strong>1. CONSUMER PRIVACY:</strong></p>
            <p>What information does CustomerLab collect from consumers?</p>
            <p><strong>Web Services:</strong></p>
            <p>In general, when a consumer uses the CustomerLab services by visiting the website or by calling a unique phone number associated with one of our Clients, CustomerLab collects that consumerвЂ™s personal information if it is made available by the consumer or by a third party. This information includes limited personal data such as the callerвЂ™s name, address, phone number and email address. CustomerLab will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of eighteen.</p>
            <p>CustomerLab or its Clients may also set up order forms, questionnaires or other mechanisms through which a consumer may be asked to provide certain information either online or via telephone or other communication medium. CustomerLab will collect such consumer-supplied information. If, however, such communications are initiated by one of CustomerLabвЂ™s Clients and the Client collects the information, CustomerLab cannot be responsible for that information, though CustomerLab does endeavor to ensure that its Clients maintain reasonable and appropriate privacy policies. Participation in any of these communications is purely voluntary; any consumer not wanting to participate or provide information may decline or terminate contact by navigating away from the web page or hanging up the phone.</p>
            <p>When a consumer responds to or views an internet advertisement served by an CustomerLab Client or visits an CustomerLab website, CustomerLab sends one or more cookies to the consumerвЂ™s computer to uniquely identify that consumerвЂ™s browser. As is common practice of doing business on the Internet, CustomerLab uses cookies to improve the quality of the Services by storing user preferences and tracking user trends and also to determine how the Services are used and navigated. Cookies that CustomerLab services on third party websites only collect data in the aggregate. While many cookies are automatically deleted at the end of a web session, CustomerLab may use persistent cookies that remain on a specific browser after termination of a session. Any consumer may set their browser to refuse cookies or automatically clear cookies after termination of a session.</p>
            <p><strong>Phone Services:</strong></p>
           <p>CustomerLab provides Client’s with unique telephone numbers to utilize on websites, emails, mobile or offline promotions. This enables CustomerLab to both determine what the consumer was viewing when making a phone call and also personalize the experience for that consumer. CustomerLab’s phone servers automatically collect the caller ID results when a consumer calls a number. CustomerLab may also collect usage information from third-party databases, including the name, address and/or geographic location of the caller when such information is available.</p>
           <p>In addition, CustomerLab’s phone servers use software that may be employed on behalf of a Client to record calls. This recorded information may be evaluated in order to determine the quality of that call from the Client’s perspective and for training or other purposes. The recorded information also enables CustomerLab to identify high-quality calls and collect additional usage data which help improve the Services and boost sales for Clients.</p>
            <p>CustomerLab may also use third-party services or technology for the transcription or analysis of such recorded information. In the event that CustomerLab records a call on behalf of a Client, CustomerLab will ensure that call participants are advised of the existence and intent of the recording in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal laws. CustomerLab is not responsible in any way for the accuracy or validity of the content of any such recordings, and takes no steps to evaluate such accuracy or validity.</p>
            <p>While CustomerLab strongly encourages Clients to adopt responsible approaches to marketing, CustomerLab is not responsible for the information practices of Clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by Clients and their partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from CustomerLab’s policy.</p>
            <p><strong>What are CustomerLab’s reasons for collecting usage information?</strong></p>
           <p>CustomerLab collects usage information when an internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, initiates a phone call, receives a phone call, makes a purchase on a Client’s website, sends CustomerLab or a Client a text message, receives a text message from CustomerLab or a Client or makes an inquiry or a purchase during a phone call to a Client. Primarily, CustomerLab collects this information for the purpose of attributing calls back to the originating ads or paying commissions to third parties and also to personalize the internet or phone user’s experience. If the internet user revisits the Client’s site directly or if the phone user calls the Client using the unique phone number again, CustomerLab is able to continue to track the user’s activities on the Client’s site and compensate third parties that referred the user. CustomerLab reserves the right to retain all data as long as may be reasonably necessary for accounting and audit purposes.</p>
           <p>Like most standard Website servers, CustomerLab uses log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. CustomerLab may use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content. We do link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
            <p>CustomerLab also may develop predictive statistical user profiles of consumers’ needs and interests by collecting both internet browsing and online purchase data and phone user data. For improved audience targeting, some CustomerLab services may use marketing technology to allow advertisers to supplement non-personally-identifying demographic information, such as age, gender, area code, or ZIP code, to the non-identifiable profile data.</p>
            <p>CustomerLab may collect personal information, such as consumers’ names, physical addresses, email addresses, phone numbers and other information in order to better target campaigns to meet user’s interests and to provide customized experiences as well as to provide the Services to Clients. CustomerLab will share this information only as described herein. CustomerLab will retain this data on behalf of Clients for as long as needed to provide the Services to that Client. CustomerLab may also retain and use personal information as necessary to comply with any legal obligations, resolve disputes and/or enforce agreements.</p>
            <p><strong>Does CustomerLab share usage information with others?</strong></p>
            <p>CustomerLab does not share consumers’ personal information with companies or individuals outside of CustomerLab except as described below:</p>
            <p>CustomerLab obtains consumer consent by requiring consumers to opt-in prior to CustomerLab sharing information with CustomerLab’s trusts third parties.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.
            </p>

            <p>For consumers accessing the CustomerLab Services through the internet, some of its cookies may have an "opt-out" option. This process does not remove the CustomerLab cookie from a consumer’s system; it simply replaces the cookie with an opt-out cookies that does not contain any unique identifiers. Some of CustomerLab’s cookies do not have an "opt-out" option, but consumers always have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their internet browser. CustomerLab does not maintain a process for an individual consumer to opt-out of an CustomerLab ad serving cookie. However, any consumer may set their browser to refuse cookies or automatically clear cookies after termination of a session.</p>
            <p>With regard to phone services, consumers are able to submit their phone numbers to "do-not-call" registries. CustomerLab will use its best efforts to observe do-not-call registries in any call campaign it performs or facilitates. However, consumers who have opted-in to receive such messages, either with a Client or with CustomerLab, shall not be subject to any do-not-call restriction.</p>
            <p>CustomerLab also partners with third-party ad networks to either display advertising on the CustomerLab website or to manage its advertising on other sites. These ad network partner(s) may use cookies and web beacons to collect non-personal information about a user’s activities on websites to provide the user with targeted advertising based upon its interests. If a user wishes to not have this information used for the purpose of being served targeted ads, a user may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the European Union click here). Please note this does not opt a user out of being served all advertising. The user will continue to receive generic ads.</p>

           <p><strong>How does CustomerLab use its Clients’ information?</strong></p>
